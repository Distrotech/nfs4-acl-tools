# NFSv4 ACL tool contextual-menu support for Nautilus/GNOME:
#
# - to install with Nautilus < 1.0.5, copy this to ~/Nautilus/scripts/
# - to install with a newer Nautilus, copy this to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/
#
# - in all cases, make that file executable with: chmod +x <file>
#
#
# i don't use GNOME or nautilus, so it might be ~/.gnome/ or something.
