to build the NFSv4 ACL Editor:

prerequisites:
	- the attr package, version 2.4.32-1 or newer.
	- the rest of the nfs4-acl-tools package built and installed.
	- Qt 4  [http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/]
	    - my configure line was: 
	        ./configure -prefix /home/richterd/projects/nfs/ACL/qt-4.1.4/ \
	          -no-tablet -no-xrandr -no-xinerama -no-nis -qt-gif -qt-libpng

building:
	once the rest of the components are installed, make sure that
	the version 4 `qmake` is in your path and export the main Qt
	installation directory (e.g., export QTDIR=/usr/local/qt-4.1.4).

	the Makefile included in the directory "nfs4-acl-editor/" is auto-
	generated by Qt and likely won't work for you.  instead, first
	run:

		$ qmake

	to generate a new Makefile from the nfs4-acl-editor.pro file.
	assuming the Makefile is made, you should just be able to type
	`make` and have it build.


contextual menu support in KDE's konqueror file-browser:
	the file "NFSv4-ACL.desktop" in this directory provides a simple 
	addition to KDE contextual menus (i.e., right-click menus) so that 
	the NFSv4 ACL tool can be easily used with konqueror.

	to enable this addition to the menus, copy "NFSv4-ACL.desktop" into, 
	e.g., /opt/kde3/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/, or where you
	choose to install servicemenus for konqueror.

	to set a custom icon for the menuitem, copy the file 
	"images/citi-icon.gif" to /opt/kde3/share/apps/konqueror/pics/.


contextual menu support in GNOME's Nautilus file-browser:
	the file "NFS4v4-ACL.nautilus" in this directory is a simple script
	which enables contextual menu (e.g., right-click) support for
	launching the NFSv4 ACL tool with Nautilus.

	to enable this addition to the menus, read the top of the file 
	"NFSv4-ACL.nautilus".  most likely, you'll just need to make the
	file executable and copy it to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/.


troubleshooting:
	it used to be that libnfs4acl.a was installed in a place like 
	/usr/lib/  so it could be found when building this GUI tool.  
	really, that was unnecessary and an artifact of a jerry-rigged 
	build setup.  now we're working with getting Qt's build system 
	to just link against libnfs4acl.a right in the build tree.  
	hopefully this will end up working sanely on most systems.

	if things break, check for obvious culprits in the qmake-generated
	Makefile and check out "INSTALL" in this package's top-level 
	directory.
